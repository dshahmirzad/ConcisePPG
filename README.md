## 🔍 Overview

This project presents a lightweight, efficient, and high-accuracy biometric verification system based on **photoplethysmography (PPG)** signals. Unlike previous approaches that require long or multiple cycles of data, our method achieves **99.96% accuracy using only a single cardiac cycle**, making it ideal for embedded and resource-constrained environments like wearables and IoT devices.

### 🚀 Key Contributions
- **Single cardiac cycle** authentication
- **Custom HF HRV feature** for enhanced accuracy
- **DTW-based normalization** and advanced preprocessing
- **Runtime benchmarks** on both PC and Raspberry Pi
- Achieves **real-time feasibility** for portable biometric systems

## 🧠 Methodology

The pipeline includes:
1. **Bandpass Filtering** using DB4 wavelet and Butterworth filters.
2. **Cardiac Cycle Segmentation** via peak and foot detection.
3. **Outlier Removal** based on RR interval thresholds.
4. **Normalization** of each cycle to 150 samples using DTW.
5. **Feature Extraction** including handcrafted HF HRV.
6. **Classification** using Gradient Boost, SVM, and other models.

## 📊 Runtime Benchmarks

We benchmarked the execution time of each component on both a desktop PC and a **Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB RAM)**:

| Task                   | PC (s)   | Raspberry Pi (s) |
|------------------------|----------|------------------|
| Feature Extraction     | 0.0001   | 0.030            |
| Segmentation           | 0.0030   | 0.101            |
| DTW Transformation     | 2.0858   | 3.548            |

These results confirm the pipeline's viability for embedded systems and real-time execution.
